18.08.2011, Matthias Koch:
  Fixed Smudge that has been appending a $0000 at the end of every definition written to Flash.
  Now the standard ANS-Create behaviour is as expected
  : ans-create <builds does> ;

28.08.2011, Matthias Koch:
  New target ! First samples of MSP430G2553 arrived. Disassembler now included.

13.09.2011 and 18.09.2011, Matthias Koch:
  Saved some space and included comparator IRQ handler in 9k for 2553.
  Entry points changed, disassembler adapted.
  First release of Ledcomm.
  Fixed severe bug in eraseflash.

02.02.2012, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.4:
  Fixed eraseflash, should be working properly now
  Behaviour of postpone for normal (and inline) words is now as specified by ANS
  Added nvariable for defining variables that allocate up to 15 words in RAM

05.05.2012, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.5:
  Number Prefix # for decimal added
  Assembler now included
  Create now aligns dictionary pointer if it is uneven
  Optimized a lot of small routines:
  - Some comparisions now take less clock cycles
  - Faster um/mod
  - Faster rshift & lshift
  - Support for Constant Generator in opcodes and literals added
  - Double literals will generate shorter code with added 2literal,
  - Deep changes in code generator

28.06.2012, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.6:
  Replaced cmove with ANS-move
  Fixed bug in d< and d>
  Added range extension for Sine and Cosine in Forth
  Added CASE in Forth

28.07.2012, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.7:
  ['] is now included in core
  Added jump, to compile special jumps
  Faster >r r@ r>
  Loop-structures now need less clock cycles: ?do do leave unloop loop +loop
  Forth-Case optimized
  Experimental Forth source for Cornerstone, close to ANS Marker, added
  Added two new analog references: adc-1.5 and adc-vcc. "Analog" still uses 2.5V.

06.10.2012 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.8:
  Tidied up source code
  Entry point of eraseflash changed, important for Cornerstone
  Deep changes in code generator
  - Smaller way to write a handful of literals
  - if now uses a faster opcode to check flags
  - bit@ cbit@ and comparisions = <> u< can be opcoded now
  - do/?do loops needs lesser code
  Rearranged words to use more short jumps
  Optimized a lot of small routines

13.10.2012 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.9:
  Case structure is now included in core
  ?do generates even shorter code
  Separate leavestack is not needed anymore
  New Flag $30 means Immediate, Compile-Only
  ?comp and ?stack removed
  Mecrisp is now almost stateless
  - only interpret uses state
  - only : ; [ ] change state
  Small optimisations here and there
  Hexdump utility for cloning now included
  Tidied up disassembler
  - takes about 500 Bytes less
  - doesn't need any global variables now

24.12.2012: Mecrisp 0.9 reaches stable !

09.04.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 0.9.1:
  New target ! First samples of MSP430G2955 arrived.
  Vectors irq-timerc0 and irq-timerc1 are for additional Timer A3.
  As MSP430G2855 and MSP430G2755 seem to differ only in Flash size,
  hex files for them are included, too, but untested.
  Adjusted jump range check constants for all targets
  in controlstructures.asm to catch too long jumps.
  This happens only to definitions with hundreds of lines, but just to be sure.
  Fresh hex files are included, they are binary compatible 
  with older Mecrisp 0.9 releases and their hexdumps.
  Updated English sources

24.06.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.0:
  Finally the first stable release of Mecrisp.
  No bugs have been found, no changes were needed.
  This is simply a cosy compilation to have all the files scattered around 
  while going the long way to stable together in one place. 

03.07.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.0 Lowpower Experimental:
  Introduced free working register r7 saved solely on IRQ entry which makes core smaller.
  Changed terminal to use ACLK and sleep in LPM3.
  Runs with 32768 Hz ACLK crystal only !
  Included definitions LPM and WAKEUP
  Adapted basis definitions to new clock

26.08.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1:
  Saved more memory and included in core: cr space / ( u*/
  Tab is now accepted as whitespace
  Introduced free working register r7 saved solely on IRQ entry for all targets
  F1612 is now equipped with UART interrupt vectors
  Lot of small optimisations in core

08.09.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1.1:
  Bugfix:  u<=  u>  <=  >

17.09.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1.2:
  Updated English sources, no changes in hex files

07.11.2013 Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 1.1.3:
  Just replaced list.txt which had a small flaw by more advanced insight.txt.
  No changes in hex files


22.02.2015, Matthias Koch, Mecrisp 2.0.0 experimental:

  New targets:

  * MSP430F5529 Launchpad
  * MSP430FR4133 FRAM Launchpad
  * MSP430FR5969 FRAM Launchpad

  So many changes !

  Mecrisp 2.0.0 is inspired by experience with Mecrisp-Stellaris,
  adds many new features, changes string handling to address-length,
  contains everything necessary for multitasking and lowpower.

  This increases core size from 9 kb to 11 kb, but I think it is
  worth it as those new features give much more convenience and fun.

  For better maintainability the source code has been restructured, many
  assembler switches and the German language source tree have been dropped.

  The list of changes would be too long, see glossary for details and
  enjoy many new ready-to-run Forth examples.

  Of course, changing so much might have introduced fresh errors,
  so if you need good stability stay with rock solid 1.1.3 for a while.
